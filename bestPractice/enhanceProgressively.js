Progressive Enhancement as a development practice is discussed in detail in the Graceful
 degradation versus progressive enhancement. In essence what you should do is write code 
 that works regardless of available technology. In the case of JavaScript, this means 
 that when scripting is not available (say on a BlackBerry, or because of an over-zealous
 security policy) your web products should still allow users to reach a certain goal,
 not block them because of the lack of JavaScript which they can’t turn on, or don’t
 want to.
