 Utilize JS Lint
JSLint is a debugger written by Douglas Crockford. Simply paste in your script, and it'll quickly 
scan for any noticeable issues and errors in your code.
"JSLint takes a JavaScript source and scans it. If it finds a problem, it returns a message
 describing the problem and an approximate location within the source. The problem is not
  necessarily a syntax error, although it often is. JSLint looks at some style conventions
   as well as structural problems. It does not prove that your program is correct. It just 
   provides another set of eyes to help spot problems."
- JSLint Documentation
Before signing off on a script, run it through JSLint just to be sure that you haven't made any
 mindless mistakes.
