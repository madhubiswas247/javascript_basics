Build on the shoulders of giants
There is no denying that over the last few years JavaScript libraries and frameworks have taken
 over the web development market. And that is not a bad thing — if they are used correctly. 
 All good JavaScript libraries want to do one thing and one thing only: make your life as a 
 developer easier by working around cross-browser inconsistencies and patching browser support
  holes. JavaScript libraries provide you with a predictable, functioning base line to build upon.

It’s a good idea to learn JavaScript without libraries first, so you really know what’s going on,
 but you should make use of a JS library when you start developing web sites. You’ll have less 
 issues to deal with and at least the bugs that appear will be ones that can be reproduced — not
  random browser issues.

My personal favourite is the Yahoo User Interface library (YUI), followed by jQuery, Dojo 
and Prototype but there are dozens of other good libraries out there and you should find the 
one that suits you and your product best.

Whilst all libraries do work well together, it is not a good idea to use several libraries in the
 same project. This brings in another superfluous level of complexity and maintenance.

Development code is not live code

If we concentrate more on making the initial code easy to understand and extend by other
 developers we can create the perfect build script. If we keep optimizing prematurely 
 we’ll never get there. Do not build for yourself or the browser — build for the next 
 developer who takes over from you.
