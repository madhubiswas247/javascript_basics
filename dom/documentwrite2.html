<!-- 
The code within the script tag is executed when the browser processes the tag. The document.write()
 method is used to delete all the existing content from the HTML document and inserts the
 
 new content specified within document.write() method. However, before the browser loads a 
 page it builds the DOM tree by parsing the HTML markup. Whenever a script tag is encountered 
 it must be executed before proceeding with the process of parsing. The script tag is split when 
 used within document.write() method because while parsing the HTML parser on seeing the “</"” 
 of the script tag inside the document.write() considers it to be the closing tag for the script
  tag within which the document.write() is enclosed. This results in incomplete execution of the 
  contents in the outer script tags. In modern days, use of document.write() method is highly 
  discouraged as it causes performance issues and may not work at all in certain cases.

Note: This procedure have been used to include jQuery files only.

Below examples implements the above approach:

Example 1: In this example, we will use <script> inside the document.write without splitting the tag.
