    <!-- 
The write() method in HTML is used to write some content or JavaScript code in a Document. 
This method is mostly used for testing purpose. It is used to delete all the content from 
the HTML document and inserts the new content. It is also used to give the additional text
 to an output which is open by the document.open() method. This method is quite similar to
  writeln() method.

When document.write() is executed, after the page load it will erase all the contents in the 
web page and only show the text inside it.
