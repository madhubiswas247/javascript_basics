<!-- 
    The document object represents the whole html document.

When html document is loaded in the browser, it becomes a document object. 
It is the root element that represents the html document. It has properties and methods. 
By the help of document object, we can add dynamic content to our web page.
The document.getElementById() method returns the element of specified id.
window.document  Is same as document 

The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface
 that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, 
 and style of a document.

 Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML
 The document.write() method should only be used for testing.

 Note: as document.write writes to the document stream, calling document.write on a closed (loaded) document automatically calls document.open, which will clear the document.
