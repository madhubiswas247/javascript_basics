    <!-- 
The Document.write() method writes a string of text to a document stream opened by document.open().

Note: as document.write writes to the document stream, calling document.write on a 
closed (loaded) document automatically calls document.open, which will clear the document.

Writing to a document that has already loaded without calling document.open() will automatically call document.open.
 Once you have finished writing, it is recommended to call document.close() to tell the 
 browser to finish loading the page. The text you write is parsed into the document's structure model.
  In the example above, the h1 element becomes a node in the document.

If the document.write() call is embedded within an inlined HTML <script> tag, then it will
     not call document.open(). For example:

<script> 
  document.write("<h1>Main title</h1>") 
</script>

Disadvantage:-

document.write and document.writeln do not work in XHTML documents (you'll get a "Operation is not 
supported" [NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR] error in the error console). This happens when opening 
a local file with the .xhtml file extension or for any document served with an application/xhtml+xml
MIME type

In Edge only, calling document.write more than once in an <iframe> causes the error SCRIPT70: Permission
denied.

Chrome will not execute <script> elements injected via document.write() in case of an HTTP cache miss
for users on a 2G connection. 

document.write in deferred or asynchronous scripts will be ignored, and you'll get a message like 
"A call to document.write() from an asynchronously-loaded external script was ignored" in the error
console.
