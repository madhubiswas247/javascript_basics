<form action="/helloMessage.php">
    <input type="text" id="name" /><br />
  
    <button type="submit"></button>
  </form>
  <!-- 
On clicking the button, the page will submit data to helloMessage.php, receives any response
 from PHP page, and (can be configured to) displays
 the response. [Or, the page could redirect somewhere else based on the submission status

 Each form submission therefore is followed by a page refresh, which is not a good user experience.

We can avoid the refresh by using a custom function to supply data to server and show response. 
We will use an event raised on button click to eliminate submit altogether.
