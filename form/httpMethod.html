<!-- The PUT Method
PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

The HEAD Method
HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.

In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users.

HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response body.

The DELETE Method
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

The OPTIONS Method
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.


BACK button/Reload	        Harmless	Data will be re-submitted (the browser should alert the user that the data are about to be re-submitted)
Bookmarked	                Can be bookmarked	Cannot be bookmarked
Cached	                    Can be cached	Not cached
Encoding type	            /x-www-form-urlencoded	application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data. Use multipart encoding for binary data
History	                    Parameters remain in browser history	Parameters are not saved in browser history
Restrictions on data length	Yes, when sending data, the GET method adds the data to the URL; and the length of a URL is limited (maximum URL length is 2048 characters)	No restrictions
Restrictions on data type	Only ASCII characters allowed	No restrictions. Binary data is also allowed
Security	                GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL
                            Never use GET when sending passwords or other sensitive information!	POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs
Visibility	                Data is visible to everyone in the URL	Data is not displayed in the URL
